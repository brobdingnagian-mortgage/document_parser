# Document Parser (aka PDF Parser)
Python Multiple and Large PDF Documents Text Extraction - Python 3.7

## Introduction
**As a Data Scientist , You may not stick to data format.** 

PDFs is good source of data, most of the organization release their data in PDFs only. **As AI is growing, we need more data for prediction and classification**; hence, ignoring PDFs as data source for you could be a blunder. 

*As you know PDF Processing comes under text analytics.*


Most of the Text Analytics Library or frameworks are designed in Python only, this gives a leverage on text analytics. You can never process a pdf directly in exising frameworks of Machine Learning or Natural Language Processing. Unless they are proving explicit interface for this, **we have to convert pdf to text first.**
## Problematic
Most Python Liabiries for Pdf Processing such as PyPDF2 and Pdfminer.six perform in text extraction task, but this performance is limited to a small and simple PDF document.

That's why, **PDFs-TextExtract** project developed to **extract text from multiple and large pdf documents.**
